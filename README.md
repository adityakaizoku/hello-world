## Saying "Hello, world!"

Remember when you typed **"Hello, world!"** in your first programming language? It's like your program's baby steps – small but super exciting.

#### My First "Hello, world!" program!

> I still smile when I think of my first time. I used C, and when **"Hello, world!"** popped up on the screen, it felt like magic. Simple words, big achievement!

**"Hello, world!"** might seem ordinary, but it's like the key that unlocks the door to coding wonderland. It's the first note in a song that turns into an incredible melody.

As you explore **"Hello, world!"** in Python, C, Java, and more, remember your first time. Let that feeling inspire you to keep exploring and creating.

_Here's to many more **"Hello, world!"** moments on your coding adventure!_ ❤️
